My codes look like:  class MyComboBox : public TComboBox { public: MyComboBox(PTWindowsObject AParent, int ResourceId, WORD ATextLen) : TComboBox(AParent, ResourceId, ATextLen) {}; virtual void WMLButtonDblClk(RTMessage Msg) = [WM_FIRST + WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK]; };  void MyComboBox::WMLButtonDblClk(RTMessage Msg) { ...// responding to the message (selecting the item in the list box) }  Anything wrong with my program? Any help would be appreciated.   \n",

Basically: Windows prefers extendend memory instead of expanded (more work to do for Win) and if no application desperatly needs EMS, you should leave emm386 with a \"REM\" in your config.sys.
